+ Make sure that the website works on moblie as well as desktop (moblie before desktop).

+ Needs to have atleast 2 designs with diffrent colours, fonts and layouts.

+ Test plans with results.

## Design

The website needs to incude 8 pages each of these pages will need to do at least something. Before choosing what each page should be and what it will do there needs to be a some components are are on each page.

+ The company name (ICUPhones) needs to be on each webpage.

+ A navbar so that visitors can access any more important webpages (home, contact us, ect) no matter what page they are on.

+ A footer potentially.

Each of the 8 pages have to fill a role.

1. Home page. The main page of the website that would contain, in theory, 3 carosels that show phones from diffrent catagorys such as highest reviewed. The home page should also be accessable through the navbar.

2. "Contact us" page. This will allow visitors to contact the company. It needs to contain an email, phone number and a form that can be filled out by a visitor. The "Contact us" page needs to be accessable through the navbar.

3. Category pages. This will be 3 or more pages that can be accessed through a link or button near the carosels on the home page. It should contain several phones possibly on a card so a picture can be included.

4. Login / Sign up page. This will be a page where a visitor can either log into an account or create a new one. This will probably be a form with the following: place to enter username, place to enter password, place to confirm password, place to enter email, place to tick wheather the visitor wants to receive emails about offers and things like that. The Login / Sign up page needs to be accessable through the navbar.

5. Phone page. This will be accessed through the catagory pages or through the carosels on the home page. It should contain a picture of the specific phone, details about the phone like the specifications and a comment section where visitors can rate phones.

6. Basket page. This will show the visitor whats current in their basket after they have put an item in there. It should be some kind of list that allows the visitor to revisit the phone they have place into the basket. Honestly have no idea how this is going to work but oh well. The basket page needs to be accessable though the navbar.

7. Check-out page. This will be accessable though the basket page via some kind of button that says "Checkout" or something similar. It should contain some kind of form that the visitor has to fill out before they can purchase that will ask for payment information and adress. It should also contain the price of all the items in the basket.

8. Forgot my username / password page. This will be accessable through the Login / Sign up page next to the login button. It will ask the user to enter their email and then it would send an email to that email containing their username and password.

### Wireframes
#### Design A
Wireframe design A has been made to look like a shopping website in terms of layout and planned page functions. Some additions could be made to make user navigation easier such as adding a drop down menu in the navbar that shows all catagorys but it would work.
#### Design B
Wireframe design B has some diffrent design choices when compaired to design A such as instead of just a few items on the homepage its instead a carousel to make the website more interactive.
### Colour scheme
I thinking that the colour scheme will consist of 3 colours that complement each other, one being for the background one for the navbar and the last for any interactive features to make them stand out from the background.
#### Design A
052F5F , 005377 , 06A77D   dark blue to blue to blueish green
#### Design B
BBBDF6 , 9893DA , 797A9E   lilac to light purple to greyish purple
### Typography
I want the fonts to be readable to the majority of people
#### Design A
Exo 2
#### Design B
Oxygen  
## Client feedback / Choice of design

### Justification
Wireframes: I chose design B as it has many more interactive features that make it more interesting to visitors rather than a long piece on each webpage.
Colour scheme: I chose design A because the colour blue is often connected to being calm and the colours are diffrent enough to easily be seperatable so the visitors can see tell interactive features apart from just the background.
Typography: I chose design A as it is readable and its easy to tell what letter is what but it also brings a sort of tech like feeling that would fit into a website designed around selling tech.
